# Why that?
I do not feel at ease with the way the rustdoc generated pages are currently structured. I fell that the docs are not easy enough to read and navigate into, especially on types with many methods with many different implementations.

I had a few ideas on how to improve the situation, so I decided to experiment them on a tiny proof of concept, demonstrating what I expect from the generated rustdoc to look like. By tinkering it and from feedback from the internal forum, I came up with a huge list of ideas to improve the documentation I would like to discus. Some of them are partially demonstrated in the prototype.
The prototype is available [there](https://utherii.github.io/new2.html), but keep in mind that it is absolutely not complete and will never be usable as a final product (full JavaScript, using old rustdoc data, no accessibility, no mobile mode, no source view, lots of bugs, lots of missing features, ...). I just use it to test quickly new ideas and get a rough idea of the visual aspect. 

# List of the different ideas I would like to be considered for rustdoc :

## Rusty theme
### What:
 - Add a new theme inspired by the "Rust" theme from mdBook
### Why: 
 - Because I like it
 - It is a (mostly) light theme but still pretty different from the existing one. 
### Details:
 - I would like to name it Rusty instead of Rust in mdBook to avoid confusion with the language name. It may seem it is some kind of official theme.   
### Questions: 
 - Is there a limit to the number of themes we want to support ?
 - Since the number of themes increase, should we resort on a dropdown instead of many radio buttons to select the theme ? If we do, we might style every line of the dropdown with the matching theme. 
 - Should we support other themes from mdbook too ? They seem less interesting to me since there are already two dark themes.
 - Do we need an authorization from mdbook author(s) ?
### What's in the prototype:
 - The prototype is based on the theme from mdbook instead of the ones from rustdoc because rustdoc was not using css variables when it was initiated. The Rust theme is used by default.

## Searchbar on the sidebar
### What:
 - Move the searchbar, the gear button and the help button to a fixed area at the top of the sidebar.
### Why:
 - Make them easier to reach from everywhere in the documentation, since most people don't learn keyboard shortcut.
 - The search bar does not need to be so large.
 - Keep all the features with a general scope in the sidebar.
### Question:
 - How to handle mobile mode?
### Issues to solve:
 - The placeholder text should be shortened.
 - The popups should be modified to go across the sidebar slider.   
### What's in the prototype:
 - The prototype has a text field in the sidebar but it is absolutely not working.
 - The prototype has only theme selection in the options and no help button .

## Tree in the sidebar
### What:
 - Introduce a tree view of the documentation entries in the sidebar
### Why:
 - The sidebar content is currently disturbing. It is sometimes related to the current level, while it is sometimes related to the higher level.
  - A tree seem natural to represent the crate/module hierarchy and the related items.
 - Allow to navigate quickly in the tree without charging a new the page every level.
 - The items that do not belong to the crate (Keyword, Primitives, ...) are clearly displayed outside of the crate at the top level.
### Details:
 - At page load, the path to the currently displayed item is unfold, but you should be able to unfold the nodes manually. 
 - Stick elements at the top when scrolling.
### Questions:
 - Does we include the implemented items in the tree too (as the current doc do), since it would be redundant with the summary (see `Summary: Table`)
 - Do we preload the whole tree. 
 - Witch icons set use for the tree elements? The icon with initials where supposed to be placeholders but they seem to work pretty well. I'm open to suggestions.
### What's in the prototype:
 - The prototype has a functional sidebar tree.

## Integrate other kind of documentations
### What:
 - Allow in the sidebar entries not directly related to a specific element in the code. It might be used to add documentation, like the "Rust Book" for std, a guide for a framework, ...
 - When you click on the item on the sidebar, the documentation is opened at the right side as a regular documentation page.
 - Links in doc-comments to files related to theses items would open on the right side too, as if they had been selected from the sidebar.
 - Searches would be able to return entries from the related documents, along with doc-commented items 
### Why:
 - For some crates the most interesting pieces of information are not directly in the Rustdoc. It would be interesting to directly access them from the sidebar as a regular item.
 - The documentation not directly related to code would really feel first party. 
### Details: 
 - Attributes in the crate would define documents to integrate and it's name and location on the documentation tree, for example `[!doc(mdbook = "../book", entry="Learning/The Book")]`. Exact syntax TBD.
### Questions:
 - What kind of doc do we want to support ?
   - Markdown files seems obvious since there is already markdown support in rustdoc
   - Link to documentation page of websites might be opened in a iframe (maybe sandboxed ?) 
   - Handling mdBooks might be more complex, but it seems interesting since it a pretty common format to write guides in the Rust community. The Rust source already include multiple mdbook and some of them are referenced in the stdlib doc-comments. 
 - Should we fully integrate, open in a new browser window or offer both options.
### What's in the prototype:
 - The prototype has a "The Book" entry, but nothing happens yet when you click on it

## Top-bar to scroll directly to the desired section
### What:
 - Every item has a header with the most basic informations(mostly just it's name and path) and a top bar that point the different sections of the documentation : Description, Summary, Details and Source. The content of those section is detailed above
 - The items that can not be implemented (functions, constants, ...) will not get Summary and Detail sections. 
### Why:
 - Move quickly to a section from anywhere in the page. It is particularly useful to :
   - go directly to the summary, if you are looking for a method and don't need the general description.
   - go back instantly to the description or summary when browsing the details or the source.
### Details:
 - The opacity of the button change to indicate the sections currently in the scroll view.
### Questions:
 - Do we keep the sections consecutive (except maybe for Source) so we can scroll from one to the other, or do we display just one at time.  
### What's in the prototype:
 - Mostly working as intended except for the Source section that is not implemented. 

## Summary : Special (and normal) implementations
 - Display informations about special behavior caused by special Trait implementation at the top of the summary. For example :
   - Operators ==, !=, [], <, <=, >, >=  available for Vec<â€¦>
   - Can be iterated providing `&'a T` items (IntoIterator<sup>ðŸ›ˆ</sup))
   - Automatically copied (Copy)
   - Can be Sent to other thread (Send)
 - Display a comma separated list of all the regular traits implementations with shortened notation(see `shortened definition`).
### Why: 
 - It is especially useful to know that some traits (Send, Copy, Iterators, PartialEq, Add, ...) are implemented on a type since it has a important impact on what you can do with those types.
 - Paradoxically you often don't need the details of the functions a trait bring to the type, because you don't use them directly (From, Add, PartialEq, ...), you already know them (Iterator), or for markers trait. 
### Questions:
  - Witch implementation should be considered special? Current ideas :
    - Trait related to operators (PartialEq, Ord, Index, Add, ...)
    - Iterator (maybe IntoIterator)
    - Copy
    - Send / Sync
### What's in the prototype:
 - The prototype inform about special implementation about operators and iterators
 - The prototype currently don't list regular implementations.

## Summary : Table
### What:
 - Display a compact table listing all the functions, constants, variants, fields, ... that belong to the item or are implemented for it.
 - Each sub-item is displayed with 3 or 4 columns :
   - an icon indicating the kind of sub-item.
   - only the name of the sub-item (full declaration on tooltip).
   - if not grouped by impl, the origin(see detail) of the sub-item (full declaration on tooltip).
   - the first sentence of the doc comment.
 - Elements can be grouped by raw name, impl, return type or self type.
 - Elements from special impl, blanket imp, or auto impl can be hidden.
 ### Why
  - Allows to get a quick overview of all the elements of the type.
  - Remove most of the useless boilerplate.
  - Grouping by name can be useful on types with a lot of overridden method or if you have a idea of the name of the function you are looking for.
### Details
  - When grouping by implementation, sub-item that don't come from implementation (variants, fields, provided/required methods,...) will be displayed in groups, named after their kind, that will be displayed before actual impl groups.
  - When grouping by self or return type, sub-item that are not functions (variants, fields, constants,...) will be displayed in groups, named after their kind, that will be displayed before self/return type groups.
  - The "origin" column of the sub-item contains :
    - The shortened definition (see `shortened definition`) of the trait providing the item, if applicable .
    - "<i>required</i>" or "<i>provided</i>" for functions defined inside a trait.
    - "<i>from</i> T" if the method is accessible through and `Deref<Target = T>` implementation.
### What's in the prototype:
  - The feature is mostly working but only for functions
  - Sometimes filtering does not work on page load

## Shortened implementation
### What:
 - At some places implementations will be shortened : 
   - only the implemented trait appear, since the implementer is the item being documented (or a related type)
   - only the implementer appear (prefixed by <i>for</i>), since the implemented trait is the item being documented.
 - The full impl definition is available in a hover popup.
 - There will be a <sup>ðŸ›ˆ</sup> mark at the end of the shortened implementation inviting to look for the full implementation in the tooltip if: 
   - The type in impl clause is not exactly the type being documented (like a reference to the type or a generic using the type).
   - If there was a where clause. 
 - The generic parameters are elided with `<...>`, unless there are only one character long.
 ### Why:
 - Full impl definitions are too complex to be displayed completely in a short list.
### Details:
 - In comma separated list, if some implementations are identical once shortened, they appear only once in the list, but the hover popup will display all the related implementations, separated by an horizontal rule. 
### Question
 - Is there a better marker than <sup>ðŸ›ˆ</sup>
### What's in the prototype:
 - Types are shortened in the "origin"" column in the summary (visible if you don't already group items by implementations) 
 - Generic are always elided with <...> even if they are only one character long.
